                 supporting distributed, multiuser applications over
                 open networks. Dreme, a distributed dialect of the
                 Scheme language in which all first-class language
                 objects are mobile in the network. In particular,
                 various distributed topologies, such as client/server
                 and peer-to-peer, can be created by migrating closures
                 with overlapping scopes around the network, correct
                 inter-process communication being assured by Scheme's
                 lexical scoping rules and network wide addressing.
                 Threads of control are passed around through
                 first-class distributed continuations. A User Interface
                 toolkit for coordinating events in multi-threaded,
                 multi-user applications by organizing continuation
                 callbacks into nested lexical scopes. Each event has
                 certain attributes, such as synchronous/asynchronous.
                 Certain events create new scopes with new events.
                 Continuation callbacks allow both synchronous events
                 which return values to their callers, and asynchronous
                 ones. Appl...",

  abstract =	"The Erlang/OTP system has a process centric model of
		 memory management. Each process is created with a local
		 heap where it allocates objects. An alternate approach
		 used in the Erlang to Scheme (ETOS) system is to have a
		 single system-wide heap in which all processes
		 allocate. We have performed an empirical performance
		 evaluation of both systems and found that in most cases
		 the unified heap approach is better because it improves
		 the speed of inter-process communication, especially
		 when large objects are transferred, it reduces the
		 overhead of garbage collection for processes with high
		 allocation rates, and it avoids fragmentation.",
