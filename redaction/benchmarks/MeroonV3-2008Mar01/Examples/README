This directory contains various programs that may serve as examples of
use of the Meroon system.

interp.scm 
        is a little Scheme interpreter written in Object-Oriented style. It
        is not very efficient but will not change since I use it as a 
        benchmark to appreciate the speed of the dispatch mechanism.
        This file originally contains two internal macros that is why there
        exists the equivalent pinterp.scm file.

pinterp.scm
        This is the same file as the previous one without internal macros.
        But Meroon macros are still there (to test the compiler).

vsg.scm
        This is the code associated to a paper describing a validation
        suite generator. The paper can be taken with
        file://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Project/icsla/Papers/vsg.ps.gz
        Some tests appear in vsg.tst and a short documentation in vsg.scm.
        This code is also used for benchmarking in conjunction with the
        vsg-bench.scm file.

This directory also contains a Bench.mkf file that allows to measure
the performance of various Scheme interpreters wrt Meroon or others
object systems. For that you only need to edit this Bench.mkf file to
update the variables telling where are Scheme interpreters. Caution,
these benchmarks run for nearly one hour on my workstation!
