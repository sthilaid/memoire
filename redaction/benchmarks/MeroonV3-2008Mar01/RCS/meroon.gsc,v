;;; The first macro is a macro definer that allows these macros to

;;; local to the sources but normally not visible from the user.

;;; Programs of the Meroon repository use define*-meroon-macro and
;;; users' programs may also want to use portable macros.  Make these
;;; macros themselves pervasive. [Thanks to Brad Lucier
;;; <lucier@@MATH.Purdue.EDU> for that nice suggestion].

;;; The problem are (1) the current file is not compiled so there is
;;; no associated .o file (2) how to make define-meroon-macro
;;; pervasive without using define-meroon-macro and thus stumbling
;;; into regression problems (3) how to make define-meroon-macro
;;; portably pervasive with a unique code (that must not depend then
;;; on the particular implementation of define-meroon-macro). 
;;; The simplest thing seems to require that each prologue defines
;;; a (make-meroon-macro-pervasive) macro that will be called in a file
;;; to be compiled (ie utils.scm).
