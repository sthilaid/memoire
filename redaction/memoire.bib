                 supporting distributed, multiuser applications over
                 open networks. Dreme, a distributed dialect of the
                 Scheme language in which all first-class language
                 objects are mobile in the network. In particular,
                 various distributed topologies, such as client/server
                 and peer-to-peer, can be created by migrating closures
                 with overlapping scopes around the network, correct
                 inter-process communication being assured by Scheme's
                 lexical scoping rules and network wide addressing.
                 Threads of control are passed around through
                 first-class distributed continuations. A User Interface
                 toolkit for coordinating events in multi-threaded,
                 multi-user applications by organizing continuation
                 callbacks into nested lexical scopes. Each event has
                 certain attributes, such as synchronous/asynchronous.
                 Certain events create new scopes with new events.
                 Continuation callbacks allow both synchronous events
                 which return values to their callers, and asynchronous
                 ones. Appl...",

		 used in the Erlang to Scheme (ETOS) system is to have a
		 single system-wide heap in which all processes
		 allocate. We have performed an empirical performance
		 evaluation of both systems and found that in most cases
		 the unified heap approach is better because it improves
		 the speed of inter-process communication, especially
		 when large objects are transferred, it reduces the
		 overhead of garbage collection for processes with high

    abstract = {{This book details the meta-object protocol, the
                  framework on which the Common Lisp object system
                  (CLOS) is based. The philosophy behind the
                  meta-object protocol is that different applications
                  may require different kinds of object models, and so
                  the object model itself should be subject to program
                  control. <I>The Art of the Meta-Object Protocol</I>
                  provides a wonderful working example of how Lisp can
                  be extended and how it can evolve to incorporate new
                  language constructs. First, the book describes how
                  CLOS is actually implemented by working through a
                  subset. Then it goes on to develop the meta- object
                  protocol in great detail. <I>The Art of the
                  Meta-Object Protocol</I> is useful for the advanced
                  CLOS user as well as for anyone interested in
                  object-oriented programming and language design. }},
