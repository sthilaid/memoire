;;; This file defines the representation of instances. They are
;;; implemented as vectors with a first slot holding the instantiation
;;; link. The words offset and index are distinguished; the former
;;; denotes offsets within the instance representation while the
;;; latter denotes natural numbers used within indexed fields.

;;; This file *SHOULD CONTAIN MACROS ONLY*. The associated functions
;;; are in the instance.scm file.

;;; Most of these functions are implemented as macros for speed.

;;; This variable designates the first offset in a vector to hold a slot.
;;; It usually is 1 (since offset 0 is reserved to the instantiation link).
;;; REMARK: if you specify the 'safer-object' feature then all Meroon 
;;; objects will contain a unique tag to make Object? safer.
