;;; This file defines the basic machinery to allocate instances. It is
;;; not general since it is not yet possible to define generic
;;; functions. This will come later with maker.scm to implement
;;; general-make.  A bunch of makers are precomputed, it is possible
;;; to augment the size of the bunch if you care about it.

;;; Try to create appropriate makers with a correct arity to avoid
;;; using general-make and consing a lot.
